# Configuration notes for various use cases

> These configurations are for my personal use and usually under construction ... so please use with care!

## Fedora 35 (`ansible/fedora/`)

My main work and private setup.

## elementary OS (`ansible/elementaryos/`)

Current until beginning of Q4 2021.
Now, I'm waiting for elementary 7.

## NixOS

Moved to repository [sonstnochwas/nixos](https://github.com/sonstnochwas/nixos)

## Distro-hopping relics

I'll use Fedora (i3wm and KDE spin) some time with my custom configuration ... which is about to be created.

## ToDo

Configuration | Description
--- | ---
`git config --global fetch.prune true` | Configure Git to automatically remove references to deleted remote branches when fetching.
